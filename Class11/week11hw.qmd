>Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes. 

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```
```{r}
#sample size
nrow(expr)
```
```{r}
#size of each genotype
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
#median
summary(expr$exp)
```


>Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(expr)+ aes(x=geno, y= exp, col=geno, fill=geno)+ geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)

summary(expr$exp)
```

#The relative expression of G/G is lower compared to A/A. Therefore, the SNP for G/G will result in less expression.
